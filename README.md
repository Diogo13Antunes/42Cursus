## About 42

[42](https://www.42.fr/) is a global network of tuition-free, nonprofit, project-based computer programming schools founded by Xavier Niel. With campuses worldwide, 42 offers an innovative education model that requires no prior programming experience, instead focusing on developing technical and interpersonal skills through peer-to-peer learning and self-paced projects.

At 42, students work in a collaborative environment without teachers or traditional classes, engaging in hands-on projects that cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and cybersecurity. The curriculum is designed to foster creativity, critical thinking, and autonomy, while real-world simulations and peer reviews encourage teamwork and resilience.

42’s unique pedagogical model is recognized globally for producing skilled, adaptable and self-motivated professionals prepared to tackle real-world challenges in tech and beyond.

### Lisboa Campus

I had the privilege of studying at [42 Lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/), where I engaged in project-based learning and peer collaboration. During my time there, I gained practical experience in algorithms, software development, and systems architecture through various hands-on projects. This unique environment fostered my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills, enabling me to work independently and adapt quickly to new technologies.

### Curriculum Overview

42's curriculum is divided into two parts: the Core and Specialization. The Core covers the fundamentals of programming and computer systems, while in the Specialization, students can choose to explore and deepen their knowledge in one or more paths of computer engineering.

### The Core
- Unix
- Shell Scripting
- C and C++
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Graphic Programming
- Docker Containers
- Web Applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL)

### The Specialization
- Web and Mobile Development
- Machine Learning
- System Administration
- Security
- Game Development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science

## About Me

I’m Diogo, born in 2002, and I have a passion for software development and technology in general. I’m currently a student at 42 Lisboa, where I am deepening my knowledge in computer engineering.

I have a keen interest in pursuing a career in software development. Therefore, I am dedicated to enhancing my skills and knowledge in this particular field.
